# Patient Health Tracker – COMP2104 Project

This is a basic C# Console Application created for our college course: **Data Centre Technologies (COMP2104)**.

The app asks for a patient's name, weight, height, and blood pressure values — then calculates:
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Blood pressure category (Normal, Elevated, etc.)
- Health status based on the input

We used Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C#, and followed the assignment instructions closely (as given by our instructor, Mr. Anmar Jarjees).

## Files Included

- `Program.cs` – Main entry point that handles user input and shows the final output
- `Patient.cs` – Class that contains logic for BMI calculation, blood pressure range, and patient info

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have **.NET SDK 9.0 or higher** installed.
2. Open the terminal inside the project folder.
3. Run:
